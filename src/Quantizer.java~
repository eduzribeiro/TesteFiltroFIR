/*
The Quantizer block passes its input signal through a stair-step function 
so that many neighboring points on the input axis are mapped to one point 
on the output axis. The effect is to quantize a smooth signal into a 
stair-step output. The output is computed using the round-to-nearest 
method, which produces an output that is symmetric about zero.

y = Q * round((u-Offset)/Q)

where y is the output, u the input, Offset is an offset, and Q the Quantization interval parameter.

y=0 for u-Offset in <-Q/2,+Q/2>
